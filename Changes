	* Change to Artistic License 2.0

1.012 2018-02-26T11:46:00Z

0.18 - 2014-01-03

0.12_01 - 2008-08-09
	* Clean up the module to work with the latest version of
	Module::Release.
	* The git command seems to exit with 1 when everything works.
	I don't know what it exits with when it fails, so don't
	bother to check for the exit value right now.

0.10_06 - 2008-08-30
	* okay, this should really fix cvs_tag

0.10_05 - 2008-08-30
